# AI Image Classifier

A binary image classifier to detect whether an image is **real** or **AI-generated** using a custom CNN built in Keras.

---

## 📦 Dataset

- **CIFAKE DATASET.zip** is included in this repo
- Contains two classes: `REAL` and `FAKE`
- All images are resized to 64×64 RGB

---

## 🧠 Model Overview

- Built using TensorFlow/Keras
- Architecture:
  - Convolutional layers
  - BatchNormalization
  - Dropout
  - Dense layers with SELU activation
- Saved model: `model_1.keras`
